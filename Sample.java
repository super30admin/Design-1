/*
The problem is to identify right bucket where you can find the your key. This identification 
is done using hashcode a good hashcode will distribute values well(load factor of hashmap)
modulus operation distributes the values for collisions well and ensures that collision list 
corresponding to each key is short.

 Idea for each push of min push previous min into the stack and for each min pop update min and pop twice.
