# Design-1

## Problem 1:
Design Hashmap (https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.
To be specific, your design should include these functions:<br>

put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value.<br>
get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.<br>
remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the mapping for the key.


## Problem 2:
Design MinStack (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.<br>
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.<br>
top() -- Get the top element.<br>
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
